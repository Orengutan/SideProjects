# Javascript

**DOM (Document Object Model)** - the dom is whatever is in the window that can be manipulated (elements(div, classes, ids), links, etc.)

- **var, let, const** - declare variables 
    - var: <=ES5 will allow reassignment and is vague
    - let: ES6 will allow reassignment 
    - const: ES6 will not allow reassignment

- **Builtin methods & Standard Data Types** 
    - Objects, Arrays, Strings, Numbers

- **ES6**
    - Arrow functions
    - rest/spread operator
    - default parameters
    - destructuring - extracting values from objects or arrays and assigning them to named variables
- **closures**: A function within a function, how does the function scope behave?
- **callbacks**: A function passed to another function to signal when there is a result ready?
- **promises**: a way to deal with future values ex. (someFunction().then(val => console.log(val)))

- **Functions & Pure functions**
    - pure functions do something without any side effects, so a pure function would take in an input and return an output without any side effects like a console.log that is also within the function. 

- **Functional Programming Basics**
    - avoids shared state and mutable data which will prevent data from becoming corrupted like having two functions simultaneously mutate the same slice of state.

# JavaScript Questions 
**Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript Developers?**
- **Functional Programming**
    - process of building software using pure functions, immutable data, no side effects,
- **Object Oriented-Programming** 
    - process of building classes and utilizing those classes which will have methods and a state assigned to them to build an application. 

- **What are the different scopes available in JavaScript?**
    **In javascript, scope is the set of variables, objects, and functions that you have access to**
    - Global/Window: will be available to the whole application 
    - local variables: will only be available to the scope that it is currently in

- **ES5 VS ES6**
    - Arrow functions 
    - Classes 
    - Modules:
    - let and const 
    - Promises 
    - Destructing assignment
    - Default parameters:
    - Template literals
    - Multi-line strings 
    - Enhanced Object literals:
